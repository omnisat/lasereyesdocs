## Why: The Problems

Building Bitcoin applications is hard. Apps need to support connecting wallets, managing Taproot addresses, signing messages and data, sending transactions, listening for events and state changes, refreshing stale indexed data, and much more. This is all on top of solving app-specific use-cases and providing polished user experiences.

The Bitcoin ecosystem is in its infancy with minimal tooling available. This creates a high barrier of entry for developers, which can stifle innovation and growth. Breaking down this barrier with a simple-to-use wallet connect library like Laser Eyes can foster greater developer adoption, which is vital to the ecosystem's success.

With the Bitcoin ecosystem being so new that this offers a perfect time to set standards and create safe and easy-to-use infrastructure. This ensures that when new users come, their exposure to scams and poor user experiences is reduced, which is the current state as every dApp needs to build its own wallet connect system.

Laser Eyes solves all these problems and more — allowing app developers to focus on building high-quality and performant experiences for Bitcoin — by focusing on developer experience, performance, feature coverage, and stability.
