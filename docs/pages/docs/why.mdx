# Laser Eyes: The Bitcoin Wallet Connector

## Why: The Problems

Building Bitcoin applications is challenging. Developers need to support multiple wallet connections, manage different address types (including Taproot), handle message and transaction signing, monitor network events, refresh blockchain data, and much more. All of this comes on top of solving app-specific use-cases and creating polished user experiences.

The Bitcoin ecosystem, despite its age, still lacks comprehensive tooling for developers. This creates a high barrier to entry, potentially stifling innovation and growth. By providing a simple-to-use wallet connection library like Laser Eyes, we can foster greater developer adoption, which is crucial for the ecosystem's success.

The current state of Bitcoin development often requires each dApp to build its own wallet connection system. This leads to inconsistencies, potential security risks, and poor user experiences. Laser Eyes aims to set standards and create safe, easy-to-use infrastructure, ensuring that as new users enter the space, their exposure to scams and subpar experiences is minimized.

Laser Eyes solves these problems by focusing on developer experience, performance, feature coverage, and stability, allowing app developers to concentrate on building high-quality and performant experiences for Bitcoin.
