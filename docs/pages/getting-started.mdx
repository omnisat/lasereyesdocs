## Read Methods

`connect lasereyes.connect()`

`Get addresses of current account lasereyes.requestAccounts()`

`Returns testnet or mainnet lasereyes.getNetwork()`

`Get public key of account lasereyes.getPublicKey()`

`Get Balance of current account lasereyes.getBalance()`

`Get All inscriptions lasereyes.getInscriptions()`

`Get All Tokens lasereyes.getAllBRC20Tokens()`

## Write Methods

Send Bitcoin `lasereyes.sendBTC(toPK, btc_in_sats, ...)`

Transferable: The amount has been inscribed into one or more TRANSFER inscriptions (can be transferred immediately). Available: The amount that is available as a part of a balance (including both minted and received) but not transferable yet. To spend an available amount, you must first inscribe a certain amount into a TRANSFER inscription.

The transfer Amount can be calculated by the sum of the chosen amounts of TRANSFER inscriptions. If you donâ€™t have enough transferable inscriptions, you will need to inscribe them first.

Once a number of TRANSFER inscriptions are chosen, proceed to send them by asserting an address sign the tx to send.

`Sign a message lasereyes.signMessage(...)`
